# rust-vscode-template

## Before Use

Change "template" in the following files to project name

* .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
* .vscode/launch.json

(Optional)

* docker-compose.yml (volume name, mount directory)

## TODO

Errors often occur at build time, probably mounting issues. Run it again and it works.

```
error: linking with `cc` failed: exit status: 1
